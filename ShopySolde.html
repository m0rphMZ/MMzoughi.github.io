							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>During my tenure at SM DEVIS in Ariana, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a team of two on an ambitious end-of-studies project called "ShopySolde." Our objective was to create a liquidation and destocking platform that would streamline the process for both sellers and buyers. As a key contributor, I was responsible for the development of the project from scratch, using the SERN (SQL, Express, React, Node) stack.</p>

								
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/ShopysoldePics1.png" alt="" /></span>To ensure a robust and user-friendly platform, I delved into self-learning to gain proficiency in React, a powerful JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. Leveraging my newfound knowledge, I designed and implemented various features that formed the core functionality of ShopySolde. Notably, I focused on crucial aspects such as user authentication, a comprehensive product catalog, and efficient inventory management.</p>
								
								<p>The development process involved working closely with my team to ensure seamless integration of the front-end and back-end components. By effectively utilizing the SERN stack, we achieved a high level of flexibility and scalability, enabling us to adapt the platform to the evolving needs of the industry.</p>
								
								<p>One of the project's highlights was the successful presentation to a panel of evaluators, where we showcased the functionality and technical aspects of ShopySolde. The presentation served as a testament to our meticulous planning, diligent development, and effective implementation of features. We received positive feedback, demonstrating the comprehensive solution we had built</p>
							
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/ShopysoldePics2.png" alt="" /></span>Overall, my experience at SM DEVIS and my involvement in the ShopySolde project allowed me to gain valuable insights into team collaboration, full-stack development, and the application of cutting-edge technologies. It was a rewarding experience that further solidified my passion for software development and showcased my ability to deliver impactful solutions.</p>
